# Welcome to Python Project 3!

In this project we are required to analyze a **log** file and generate different reports. The reports are as follows.
- **Suspicious Activity**
- **Irresponsible behaviour**
- **System Glitch**
- **Domain Count**

## Suspicious Activity:
In this reporting we are required to filter out the users who log in between **12 and 5 AM or log in 5 times in a day**. Each suspicious activity of the user in one day should be reported as a count of 1. The detailed flowchart is attached in this repo inside the flowcharts folder.

## Irresponsible Behaviour:
In this reporting we are required to filter out the users who are irresponsible in a sense that they forgot to logout from any of the server after loggin in. Simply if the **login count in a day is greate than logout count** of that day then. The detailed flowchart is attached in this repo inside the flowcharts folder.

## System Glitch:
In this reporting we are required to filter out the records in which user **logged in more times than he logged in**. This is not possible so we will label this as system glitch. The detailed flowchart is attached in this repo inside the flowcharts folder.

## Domain Count
In this reporting we are required to count all the domains and the number of users associated with each domain. The detailed flowchart is attached in this repo inside the flowcharts folder.

# Week II Deliverable.
## Flow charts
The flow charts of all the repoting is placed inside **FlowCharts** folder in this repo. The name of the file associate with the report.

## Python Notebook for opening file.
The python notebook that have the code to open the file is also attached with the name **Reading Log File**. 

# Week III Deliverables.
## Python Notebooks
In this week we are supposed to deliver the final jupyter notebooks that have running code. The code should produce the report files.

## Reports Generated.
Along with Python notebooks we are supposed to deliver the reoprts generated from your code.

## Notebook in HTML format.
The notebook exported in HTML should also be uploaded.

Note: The notebooks is well commented and self Explanatory.
