This projec tis about analyzing the logs generated by the system. 
The analysis is done to get information about different events such as suspicious 
activity count, irresponsible acts done by the user and other.

The logs are given in the .log form. The better way to handle these types of file
is to operate on them using a library called pandas.Pandas is used by data scientist 
to easily manage large amount of data. Pandas also help and data analysis. Data Frame 
is the data structures used by pandas. DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure 
with columns  of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or
SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used pandas object.
Like Series, DataFrame accepts many different kinds of input.

Pandas give us different functions to analyze the data. For example finding the unique
elements in a columns. Relating one column with another, grouping multiple columns, it 
also provide handy graphs that further increase the effecieny.

In addition to pandas I have used dictionaries (more appropriately nested dictionaries)
dictionaries help in organizing the records without having to worry about duplicates.

There will be total of 4 functions. One for each type of report and also I will try to include
one for the extra credit part. The dataframe passed to these functions is pre-processed.

The fucntions will be named as follow:
        generate_<reportName>_report()
all the functions will take the parameter of datatype Dataframe as we are dealing with
pandas table.
Little insight on the functions:
      generate_suspicious_report()
          a. group the table by the date. this will combine all the activities on the same
             date will be combined together.
          b. then group the table by the usernames.
          c. proceed further with the requirement

Reason to use dataframe:
  This files can be handled by opening the files and reading the data in the list and then working on it.
  But accessing data from list of lists using indexes is a ineffecient technique when analyzing the data
